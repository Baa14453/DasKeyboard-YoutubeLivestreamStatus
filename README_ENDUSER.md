# Q Applet: Youtube Livestream Status

Displays the status of your chosen youtuber as a colour on your keyboard.
This program was built to monitor vtubers and I have no shame in admitting that.

Currently you supply a Youtube API Key and a Youtube Channel ID to configure the app.
In future I'll make this a Google Login and it will let you choose from your subscribers, this makes more sense.
